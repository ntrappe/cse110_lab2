#### CSE 110 Lab 2: HTML, DevTools, and GitHub Pages P2
##### By Nicole Trappe #####

Checkout out the [main HTML Page](index.html) which also references an [HTML form](survey.html). 

Checkout the GitHub page [here.](https://ntrappe.github.io/cse110_lab2/)

For the TA reading this, all the **Forms** content (e.g. textarea, option) is in [survey.html](survey.html). It also includes 11 types of input: 1 checkbox, 2 radio, 3 date, 4 range, 5 button, 6 tel, 7 file, 8 url, 9 submit, 10 date time , 11 text. Also, I did use a fair amount of CSS to prettify things--I just can't help it. But I've got all the major HTML components so hopefully that doesn't detract.
